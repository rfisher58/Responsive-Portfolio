                        As for a personal background, I graduated from Texas A&M with a degree in construction science. I come from a family of seven, and I am the oldest child and only brother to four younger sisters. I am happily engaged to my lovely fiancé, Hannah Lewis. Currently I reside in our new apartment in the Historic West End of Dallas. 
                        I think when I look at who I was for the first 22 years of my life, I see a guy who was great at making it. What I mean is, if it required me to get a 95% on my final to ensure I had a B in the class. You could count on me getting that 95 to achieve a B. If there ever was a situation that had a near impossible deadline, I will be the one to complete whatever it is on time. But the thing is, I always, and I mean always was the person was having to “make it.” I have always been this person. Someone who could pull it out of his rear end at a moment’s notice. But in technology, I have found something that I find to be what was made for me. I have a desire to accomplish so much as a growing developer. 
                        My dad has been in the technology industry since he graduated high school. He has worked for companies like Microsoft, and Projeckt 202 I have always been interested in the field but had hesitation because I didn’t want to be someone who just did something their dad did. After working at my previous employer as a project estimator, I concluded I hated my job. I figured I was young enough, and a bit of a risk taker, so I jumped ship and climbed aboard the CSS Technology. Where I think I have found what I want to do for the rest of my life.
